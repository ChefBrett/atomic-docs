title: Working with Less and Stylus
permalink: /docs/less-stylus

<p>By default, Atomic Docs is set up for Sass. Setting up Atomic Docs with Less or Stylus is pretty easy, but comes with one caveat.</p>

<h2>Caveat</h2>
<p>By convention, LESS and Stylus partials are not prefixed with an underscore like Sass partials are. In Atomic Docs,
    at least for the moment, all partials are created with the underscore whether Sass, Less or Stylus. Everything still works as it should though, so if the underscores don't bother you, you're good to go.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<p>The following are the steps for setting up Atomic Docs to work with Less. For stylus use the <span class="highLight">styl</span>
    extension instead of <span class="highLight">less</span> as shown in the example.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The first thing you'll need to do is go to <span class="highLight">http://localhost/atomic-docs/atomic-core/</span> and use the <span class="highLight">+ Add / Delete Category</span> link to remove the modules and box component example. Since the example is in Sass you will encounter issues later if you are working with Less or Stylus.</li>
    <li> Open up atomic-config.php in the root and change <span class="highLight">$config['preCssDir']</span> to equal <span
            class="highLight">less</span>. Also change <span class="highLight">$config['preCssExt']</span> to equal <span
            class="highLight">less</span> (you can name this whatever you want actually).
<pre><code class="language-php"><script>
function getConfig() {
    $config = array();
    $config['dir'] = dirname(__FILE__);
    //user defined varibales
    $config['preCssDir'] = 'less'; //Scss preprocessor directory name. E.G sass, less
    $config['preCssExt'] = 'less'; //prerocessed file ext. E.G. scss, sass, less
    $config['compExt'] = 'php'; //markup file ext. E.G. html, twig, etc...
    return $config;
}
</script>
</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Set up your pre-processor and start creating your categories and components at <span class="highLight">http://localhost/atomic-docs/atomic-core/</span>.</li>
</ul>
