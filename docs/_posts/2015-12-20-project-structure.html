  <dt>atomic-docs/</dt>
  <dd>The root project directory. Change to whatever the name of your project is.</dd>
  <dt>atomic-core/</dt>
  <dd>The directory that holds the atomic-docs application logic. (I'm stricly a front-end programmer, view my janky backend code at your own risk)</dd>
  <dt>atomic-db/</dt>
  <dd>The flat file database that stores the information for your components, categories and settings.</dd>
  <dt>components/</dt>
  <dd>This directory holds the component files where you will be authoring your html. For example, if you create a component named "box", you would find box.html in this directory.</dd>
  <dt>css/</dt>
  <dd>Nothing fancy here. Just the usual css directory that your sass/less files will be preprocessed into.</dd>
  <dt>scss/</dt>
  <dd>The scss directory where you author the styles for your components. For example, if you create a component named "box", you would find _box.scss in this directory. You can change this directory name to whatever you want. Just make sure to update the name in the config.php file.</dd>
  <dt>.htaccss</dt>
  <dd>Used to turn output_buffering to on to solve error issues in osx. Need to find a better solution, this works for now however.</dd>
  <dt>config.php</dt>
  <dd>Change certain defaults here. You can change the component extension from .php to .html or .mustache or whatever you'd like.</dd>
  <dt>index.php</dt>
  <dd>Your projects index file. </dd>
  <dt>atomic-head.php</dt>
  <dd>Any code you want shared between the head section of the styleguide and your project's head. Google font links etc...</dd>
  <dt>atomic-foot.php</dt>
  <dd>Any code you want shared between the footer of your styleguide and your project's footer. Additional scripts that aren't js/main.js etc...</dd>
